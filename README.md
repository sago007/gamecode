# OpenArena gamecode 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OpenArena/gamecode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OpenArena/gamecode)

## Description ##
This is the game code part of OpenArena. In mod form it is referred as OpenArenaExpanded (OAX).

## Building ##

See http://openarena.wikia.com/wiki/OpenArena_eXpanded for detailed build instructions

## Extracting entities ##
It is possible to extract entity definition for use with GtkRadiant 1.6 like this:

```
cd code/game
./extract_entities.sh > openarena.def
```

Note that these entities will not work with GtkRadiant 1.5 and NetRadiant 1.5 because they use a XML-based format (although there are not that much XML information in it)
